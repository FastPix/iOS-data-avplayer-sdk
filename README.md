**FastPix Video Data AVPlayer** enhances the integration steps with [AVPlayer](https://github.com/iOS-video-data-avplayer), enabling the collection of player analytics. It enables automatic tracking of video performance metrics, making the data readily available on the [FastPix dashboard](https://dashboard.fastpix.io) for monitoring and analysis. While the SDK is developed in Swift, the published spm package currently includes only the Swift output.

# Key Features:

- **Track Viewer Engagement:** Gain insights into how users interact with your videos.
- **Monitor Playback Quality:** Ensure video streaming by monitoring real-time metrics, including bitrate, buffering, startup performance, render quality, and playback failure errors.
- **Error Management:** Identify and resolve playback failures quickly with detailed error reports.
- **Customizable Tracking:** Flexible configuration to match your specific monitoring needs.
- **Centralized Dashboard:** Visualize and compare metrics on the [FastPix dashboard](https://dashboard.fastpix.io) to make data-driven decisions.
- **Compatible with tvOS:** Monitor and track video playback and analytics specifically on Apple TV when using AVPlayer, just like on iOS.

# Prerequisites:

## Getting started with FastPix:

To track and analyze video performance, initialize the SDK with your Workspace key (learn more about [Workspaces here](https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/workspaces)):

1. **[Access the FastPix Dashboard](https://dashboard.fastpix.io)**: Log in and navigate to the Workspaces section.
2. **Locate Your Workspace Key**: Copy the Workspace Key for client-side monitoring. Include this key in your Swift code on every page where you want to track video performance.

# Step 1: Installation and Setup:

To get started with this SDK, you can integrate it into your project using **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**. Follow these steps to add the package to your iOS project.

1. **Open your Xcode project** and navigate to:
   ```
   File → Add Packages…
   ```

2. **Enter the repository URL** for the FastPix SDK:
   ```
   https://github.com/fastpix/iOS-video-data-avplayer.git
   ```

3. **Choose the latest stable version** and click `Add Package`.

4. **Select the target** where you want to use the SDK and click `Add Package`.


# Step 2: Basic Integration

To integrate this SDK into your project, follow these steps:

## Import the SDK:

First, import the SDK into your Swift project:

```swift
import FastpixVideoDataAVPlayer
```

##  Initialize and Configure the SDK:

Create an instance of initAvPlayerTracking.

```swift
import FastpixVideoDataAVPlayer

let fpDataSDK = initAvPlayerTracking()

let customMetadata = [
  "data": [
        workspace_id: "WORKSPACE_KEY", // Unique key to identify your workspace (replace with your actual workspace key)
        video_title: "Test Content", // Title of the video being played (replace with the actual title of your video)
        video_id: "f01a98s76t90p88i67x", // A unique identifier for the video (replace with your actual video ID for tracking purposes)
  ]
]

// Track AVPlayer Layer
fpDataSDK.trackAvPlayerLayer(
    playerLayer: playerLayer,   // The AVPlayerLayer instance managing the playback
    customMetadata: customMetadata
)

// Track AVPlayer
fpDataSDK.trackAvPlayer(
    player: player,   // The AVPlayer instance managing the playback
    customMetadata: customMetadata
)

// Track AVPlayer Controller
fpDataSDK.trackAvPlayerController(
    playerController: playerController,   // The AVPlayerViewController instance managing the playback
    customMetadata: customMetadata
)
```

## Define player metadata

Check out the [user-passable metadata](https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/user-passable-metadata) documentation to see the metadata supported by FastPix. You can use custom metadata fields like `custom_1` to `custom_10` for your business logic, giving you the flexibility to pass any required values. Named attributes, such as `video_title` and `video_id`, can be passed directly as they are.

```swift
let customMetadata = [
    "data": [
        workspace_id: "WORKSPACE_KEY", // Unique key to identify your workspace (replace with your actual workspace key)
        video_title: "Test Content", // Title of the video being played (replace with the actual title of your video)
        video_id: "f01a98s76t90p88i67x", // A unique identifier for the video (replace with your actual video ID for tracking purposes)
        viewer_id: "user12345", // A unique identifier for the viewer (e.g., user ID, session ID, or any other unique value)
        video_content_type: "series", // Type of content being played (e.g., series, movie, etc.)
        video_stream_type: "on-demand", // Type of streaming (e.g., live, on-demand)

        // Custom fields for additional business logic
        custom_1: "", // Use this field to pass any additional data needed for your specific business logic
        custom_2: "", // Use this field to pass any additional data needed for your specific business logic

        // Add any additional metadata
    ]
]
```

### Note:

Keep metadata consistent across different video loads to make comparison easier in your analytics dashboard.

### Changing video streams in player

When your application plays multiple videos back-to-back in the same player, it’s essential to notify the FastPix SDK whenever a new video starts; possibly in scenarios like playlist content/ video series or any other video that user wants to play.

```swift
import FastpixVideoDataAVPlayer

let fpDataSDK = initAvPlayerTracking()

fpDataSDK.trackAvPlayerLayer(
    playerLayer: playerView.renderingView.playerLayer,
    customMetadata: customMetadata
)

fpDataSDK.dispatchEvent(event: "videoChange", metadata: [
    video_id: "123def", // Unique identifier for the new video
    video_title: "Daalcheeni", // Title of the new video
    video_series: "Comedy Capsule", // Series name if applicable

    // ... and other metadata
])
```

# Supporting tvOS :
 
Alongside iOS, the FastPix Video Data Core SDK also supports tvOS, allowing you to collect detailed playback analytics from your Apple TV apps when using AVPlayer. You can track viewer engagement, playback quality, errors, and custom events on Apple TV just as you do on iOS.
 
We’ve tested the SDK on tvOS to ensure a smooth experience, but if you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to us.
